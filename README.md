## Description

Cloudy Adventures is a 3D game where you control a cloud, using the mouse to navigate the world and water plants, causing them to grow. Camera perspective is orthographic, and camera controls are similar to League of Legends.

## Features

*   Unique cloud control using the mouse (similar to League of Legends).
*   Water plants to stimulate their growth.
*   Limited water supply, requiring strategic planning.
*   Charming low-poly art style.

## Planned Features (Under Development)

*   Extinguishing fires: Players will need to strategically use their water supply to put out fires that threaten the environment.
*   Cloud upgrades: Players can upgrade their cloud's stats, such as water capacity, movement speed, and rain radius.
*   Plant upgrades: Plants can be upgraded to increase their growth speed, water efficiency, and the rewards they provide.

## Technologies

*   C#

## Controls
